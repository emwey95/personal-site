  <h1>The Best Movies According to Emily</h1>
  <h2>My favorite movies! Take a look!</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>La La Land</h3>
  <p>
    This is one of my favorite movies for 2 reasons, the soundtrack and the
    story. The soundtrack is incredibly moving. I got the opportunity to attend
    a Dallas Symphony Orchestra showing of La La Land, where the orchestra
    played the soundtrack live to the movie. It was such a powerful and
    immersive experience.

  <p>
    The story pulls at the heartstrings. It is about 2 artists that are trying
    their best to make it in their passion. This speaks to me as I was once a
    musician who also had big dreams. The story also ties in to the romantic
    side of things, but is not over-the-top or corny. The story as a whole is
    tragic yet beautiful, as often is life.

  <h3>A Star is Born</h3>
  <p>
    A Star is Born, feauturing Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is a movie that
    always draws me tears. It takes a deep dive into mental health and the
    struggles of depression, alcholoism, and the struggles that those carry into
    relationships. I can relate to this movie on a multitude of levels, and it
    paints a really great picture of what it is like for someone dealing with
    major depressing and suicidal thoughts.
  </p>
  <h3>The Barbie Movie</h3>
  <p>
    This movie does such an incredible job with subtle meanings. Although at
    first glance, the movie seems to be covered in pink, lighthearted fun, there
    is a way deeper meaning behind everything going on. Barbie goes on an
    adventure to figure out who she is in the world. You get taken on a journey
    to find meaning and purpose, running into obstacles, road blocks, and
    internal fears and struggles. The first time I saw this in theatres, I had
    no idea what to expect, but it easily became one of my favorite movies.
